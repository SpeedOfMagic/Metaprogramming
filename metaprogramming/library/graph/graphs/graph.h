 * Represents placeholder for a graph.
 * Graph is a pair of vertexes (collection of some elements), and edges (collection of pairs of vertexes).
 * Graph can be represented in multiple ways in code. This library provides several preexisting implementaions.
 * Also it should be noted that preexisting implementations are built in compile-time, and it's recommended to follow this rule.
