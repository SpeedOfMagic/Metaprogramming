\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents placeholder for a graph. \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_graph}{Graph}} is a pair of vertexes (collection of some elements), and edges (collection of pairs of vertexes). \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_graph}{Graph}} can be represented in multiple ways in code. This library provides several preexisting implementaions. Also it should be noted that preexisting implementations are built in compile-\/time, and it\textquotesingle{}s recommended to follow this rule. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
graph/graphs/graph.\+h\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
